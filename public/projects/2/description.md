# GitOps Demo Project

## Overview

This project implements a modern cloud-native infrastructure using GitOps principles, combining the power of GitHub Actions, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and robust monitoring solutions. The architecture ensures continuous deployment, secure operations, and comprehensive system observability.

## Architecture Components

### CI/CD Pipeline
The project leverages GitHub Actions as the primary CI/CD solution, providing:
- Automated build and test processes
- Continuous deployment to AKS
- Integration with GitOps workflows
- Automated security scanning and quality checks

### Cloud Infrastructure
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) serves as our container orchestration platform, offering:
- Scalable container deployment
- Built-in security and compliance
- High availability and disaster recovery
- Integration with Azure services

### GitOps Implementation
Our GitOps approach uses GitHub as the single source of truth, ensuring:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices
- Automated synchronization between Git and cluster state
- Version control for all configurations
- Automated drift detection and remediation

### Secret Management
The project implements a multi-layered secret management strategy:
- SOPS (Secrets OPerationS) for Git-stored encrypted secrets
- Azure Key Vault integration for secure secret storage
- Kubernetes Secrets for runtime configuration
- Encryption at rest and in transit

### Monitoring and Observability
The monitoring stack consists of:

#### Prometheus
- Metrics collection and storage
- Performance monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking
- Custom metrics support

#### Grafana
- Customizable dashboards
- Real-time data visualization
- Performance analytics
- Trend analysis and reporting

#### Alertmanager
- Alert routing and grouping
- Notification management
- Alert deduplication
- Customizable alert rules

### Self-Healing Capabilities
The infrastructure implements automatic recovery mechanisms through:
- Kubernetes liveness probes
- Automatic pod restarts
- Resource limits and scaling
- Health check endpoints

## Project Benefits

- **Consistency**: Guaranteed alignment between Git configuration and cluster state
- **Security**: Multi-layered security approach with encrypted secrets and access controls
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
- **Reliability**: Self-healing capabilities and automated recovery
- **Scalability**: Cloud-native architecture supporting dynamic scaling
